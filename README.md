## Know the basics

| Differences                            |                                        ReactJS                                        |                                                NextJS                                                |
| :------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Type                                   |                                  This is a `Library`                                  |                                        This is a `framework`                                         |
| What it does?                          |       ReactJS does one thing and does it best which is to build UI components.        |          Its a collection of tools to give you a complete pack to build a full fledged app.          |
| Uses                                   |                Can be used to build any type of webpages (almost all).                |          Better for small and `static` webapps but are also very good for dynamic webapps.           |
| Routing                                |          For routing one uses the best package which is `react-router-dom`.           |                                   It has built-in routing system.                                    |
| Extending features and adding new ones | It is very easy to add more features, loaders, components, etc but with npm packages. | There are basic and common tools provided by the next package but can be extended with npm packages. |

### Typescript: Basics

- For people who have used `C++` and `Python`, comparing `Javascript` and `Typescript` is very similar in terms of generics and literals. In javascript, we don't have to specify the variable type and generics. But in typescript, we can specify the types and generics of the variable, what the function returns and what the function type is.

- In a nutshell, while using javascript you can create your ways and the maze and figure your way out and while using typescript you already know what the way out is you just have to know the right direction.

PS - I will add more later.
